# Errands Tracking App

Simple ̷T̷o̷-̷d̷o̷  Errands Tracking application focused on REST API consuming using Retrofit2, Hilt, Coroutines and MockWebServer, all through Test Driven Development approach.

## Introduction

This Errands Tracking Application is for learning purposes, as it works with dummy data to show REST API consuming using _soa_ Android development tools.
If you either a student or profissional, and want to learn how to consume diferent REST API definitions from your _Kotlin_ code, this repo takes a step further and does it applying TDD approach, assuring test code coverage.
